            Last Month on February 17th, I completed the Google’s Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform specialization on Coursera. I’ve previously studied and practiced Data Science and Machine Learning from a local Mentor and few online resources and was well aware of Python programming and Machine Learning concepts. If you are not aware of these I’d highly recommend you to at least learn Python and then take the Specialization
        </p>
        <p>
            No prior Knowledge of Cloud, Machine Learning or TensorFlow is required for this Specialization. But some basic understanding would help, especially when you want to save some money. Now how did I save money? Will get to it later. The Specialization has 5 courses each course completion will get you a certificate from Google Cloud issued by Coursera. You can also take Courses separately instead of the Specialization.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Specialization starts off great with tutorials, quiz and lab sessions but as it goes further the labs are disappointing and feels like the code is forced on to you. If you’re planning to complete the course ASAP, it will be more of a chore than learning. The specialization also seems to be focused on implementation of Google Cloud Platform in your business rather than educating students.
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <b>Course 1: How Google Does Machine Learning</b>
        <p>
            This course is short and serves as a great intro to ML and what google are trying to achieve with it. This course does a great job of clearly explaining why machine learning can be so transformative for their business. As I was familiar with this before hand, it didn’t intrigue me much. But will be excellent for the beginners
        </p>

        <b>Course 2: Launching into Machine Learning</b>
        <p>
            This course mainly covered the basics of machine learning like loss function, common algorithms, neural nets, etc. Again, I was already familiar with these topics I didn’t have a lot of new information for me aside from BigQuery and few best practices. But definitely important for beginners.
        </p>
        <p>
            The course will start with creating a virtual instance on GCP and creating datalabs .This course will teach you how to repeatedly split data into training and test sets. Before I’ve used functions that use random numbers to split data and not thought twice about it. However, if you work in a team or later want to rerun the model on an updated data set you need a way to do so that will give the same split every time. The method they use is to create a hash value of one of the variables with the FARM_FINGERPRINT function, divide by either 10 or the amount of subsets wanted and then use the remainder to split on.
        </p>

        <br>

        <b>Course 3: Intro to TensorFlow</b>
        <p>
            This is where things start getting more technical and coding is involved. This is my favorite course of all. This will get you starting with TensorFlow and building and training models on the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
            The labs on this course are not much fun. All the code is readily available in the form of notebook. This is just a run and observe scenario. In short these labs are not enough to master TensorFlow at all.
        </p>

        <br>

        <b>Course 4: Feature Engineering</b>
        <p>
            This will help you preprocess the data before even getting into building and training models. it will help you illustrates the importance of representing features correctly. This course also has great tutorials on using Apache Beam on Cloud Dataflow for preprocessing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall the course is great and was filled with unknown topics for me. But has the same problem with labs.
        </p>

        <br>

        <b>Course 5: Art and Science of ML</b>
        <p>
            This course deals with tuning and regularize the model to get better results from it. The later part of the course covers Neural nets and training them. Also has great tutorials on Embeddings and Custom Estimators.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <b>Verdict</b>
        <p>
            The course is great for business already familiar with Machine Learning and want to build models for business. I came here to upgrade my skills and to take my ML practice to the next level with GCP, which I definitely did but I think the course should have offered more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall the Specialization is great and offers insights and best practices for ML. If you are looking for something to learn or a certified program that can help you to build your profile, this specialization will definitely deliver.
        </p>
